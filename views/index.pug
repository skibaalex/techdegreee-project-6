            img.thumbnail(src=`${project.previewImg}`, alt=`image of ${project.name.toLowerCase()} project`)
            h5 #{project.name}

      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

        .cell
          a(href='#')
            img.thumbnail(src='https://placehold.it/550x550', alt='')
